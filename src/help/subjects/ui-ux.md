      # New challenges for the modern office


      With the rise of online shopping, more and more people are receiving
      deliveries on a regular basis. Couple that with the fact that deliveries
      require a secure drop-off location, and many employees prefer having
      packages delivered to their offices instead of their homes.


      And it’s not just small boxes from Amazon, either. It’s not uncommon for
      office managers and receptionists to deal with everything from standard
      parcels and envelopes, to food and flowers, to huge deliveries like tires
      and furniture!


      ## Developing ad hoc solutions


      Whether you know it or not, someone at your workplace is likely handling
      delivery management already. What we call delivery management is really
      just making sure the deliveries that arrive in your office get into the
      proper recipient’s hands.


      ## A better way to manage deliveries


      Envoy is on the forefront of solving this problem with a modern solution.
      Deliveries automates the majority of delivery management work, so your
      operations and admin teams can handle more business-critical issues.


      The idea is simple, but the technology is smart. Here’s how it works:


      * You use your phone to snap a photo of each delivery’s shipping label.
      Envoy uses optical character recognition to “read” the recipient’s name
      and match it with an employee in your directory.

      * Then, that person gets automatically notified to pick up their delivery.
      When they come to the designated delivery area, they’ll collect their
      package. They can mark it as picked up in one of two ways: either on an
      (optional) iPad kiosk or directly from their notification.

      * And if the delivery hasn’t been picked up yet, Envoy can automatically
      remind the recipient on a schedule you specify.
