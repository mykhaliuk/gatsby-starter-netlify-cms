      # New challenges for the modern office


      With the rise of online shopping, more and more people are receiving
      deliveries on a regular basis. Couple that with the fact that deliveries
      require a secure drop-off location, and many employees prefer having
      packages delivered to their offices instead of their homes.


      And it’s not just small boxes from Amazon, either. It’s not uncommon for
      office managers and receptionists to deal with everything from standard
      parcels and envelopes, to food and flowers, to huge deliveries like tires
      and furniture!


      ## Developing ad hoc solutions


      Whether you know it or not, someone at your workplace is likely handling
      delivery management already. What we call delivery management is really
      just making sure the deliveries that arrive in your office get into the
      proper recipient’s hands.


      ## A better way to manage deliveries


      Envoy is on the forefront of solving this problem with a modern solution.
      Deliveries automates the majority of delivery management work, so your
      operations and admin teams can handle more business-critical issues.


      The idea is simple, but the technology is smart. Here’s how it works:


      * You use your phone to snap a photo of each delivery’s shipping label.
      Envoy uses optical character recognition to “read” the recipient’s name
      and match it with an employee in your directory.

      * Then, that person gets automatically notified to pick up their delivery.
      When they come to the designated delivery area, they’ll collect their
      package. They can mark it as picked up in one of two ways: either on an
      (optional) iPad kiosk or directly from their notification.

      * And if the delivery hasn’t been picked up yet, Envoy can automatically
      remind the recipient on a schedule you specify.

      # How Deliveries works


      Deliveries is a digital solution that helps you manage packages and
      deliveries that arrive at your office.


      * You use your phone to snap a photo of each delivery’s shipping label.
      Envoy uses optical character recognition to “read” the recipient’s name
      and match it with an employee in your directory.

      * Then, that person gets automatically notified to pick up their delivery.
      When they come to the designated delivery area, they’ll collect their
      package. They can mark it as ‘picked up’ in one of two ways: either on an
      (optional) iPad kiosk or directly from their notification.

      * If the delivery doesn’t get picked up in a timely manner, Envoy
      Deliveries can send automatic reminders on the schedule of your choice.


      Envoy Deliveries is free to use for up to 100 deliveries per month. And if
      you have a more active office, pricing starts at $159 per month, per
      delivery area.


      # Deliveries key features


      ## Recording deliveries


      The first step is recording a new delivery. With Envoy Deliveries, you
      don’t need a barcode scanner or special equipment. All you need is your
      phone.


      To record a delivery, just open the Envoy Deliveries mobile app (available
      on iOS and Android) and snap a photo of the shipping label. The rest
      happens automatically. The name on the label is processed and the delivery
      is added to your delivery log.


      ## Notifications


      Envoy Deliveries will alert your team members when their deliveries are
      recorded. These instant, automatic notifications mean you’ll never have to
      manually call or message someone to pick up their deliveries. Currently,
      notifications can be sent via email and Slack— and more notification
      methods are coming soon!


      ## Delivery pick-up


      Recipients must mark their deliveries as ‘picked up’ when they come to
      collect them. Otherwise, Envoy Deliveries will not know they’ve been
      collected. Until a delivery is marked as ‘picked up,’ the recipient will
      continue to receive reminder notifications.


      > If you’re not a Global Admin, we’d still love to you to sign up! When
      you do so, your Global Admin(s) will be notified that you’re interested in
      Deliveries.
